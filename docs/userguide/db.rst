.. _BalsamDB:

The Balsam Database
===================

Every Balsam instance is associated with a persistent **database** directory, 
which is created with the :bash:`balsam init <db-path>` command (see :ref:`BalsamInit`). 
You will find this contains the following:

- **balsamdb/**:  The actual PostgreSQL database directory.  The *balsamdb/log/* 
  directory contains PostgreSQL server logs showing, in detail, how Balsam clients 
  are talking to the database.  This is probably only useful for Balsam developers during
  debugging. The *balsamdb/postgresql.conf* contains the adjustable PostgreSQL
  configuration.  This is auto-set during :bash:`balsam init` and :bash:`balsamactivate`, 
  and you probably never need to look here either.
- **data/**:  By default, all task working directories will be created under this 
  directory according to the schema `data/<workflow>/<name>_<id>`.  The stdout/stderr of 
  every task running in Balsam will be directed here.  See :ref:`BalsamJob` for details
  on how to set your own working directory, if you insist.
- **log/**:  A separate log file is created by each launcher instance and the 
  Balsam service. There will be detailed log messages for every task launch and 
  error that occurs in the course of your workflow.  Look here or stream logs in real-time with
  :bash:`balsam log` if you need to closely inspect what's going on.
- **qsubmit/**: this directory stores every launcher job script that is 
  submitted to the local batch scheduler.  The stdout/stderr and scheduler logs
  corresponding to these scripts is directed here as well.
- **server-info**: this file holds a little bit of JSON data that tells Balsam
  components what host and port the database server is running on

.. warning::
    If you ever move your database around on the file system or adjust
    permissions, keep in mind that the permissions on the **balsamdb/**
    subdirectory **must** remain as 700 (:bash:`chmod balsamdb/ 700`). For
    security reasons, PostgreSQL will refuse to start if this folder has
    permissions set differently. The other directories can easily be
    shared with collaborators in your UNIX group.


Starting up the Balsam database Server
--------------------------------------
To point your current terminal session at a particular Balsam DB, use:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ . balsamactivate <db-path or name>

This will a start a server process on the current node, if one isn't already
running yet. Otherwise, it will connect to the existing server referenced in
the **server-info**. The Postgres server stays alive even when you log off,
so subsequent jobs and CLI sessions will typically re-connect to the same
server.

.. note::
    The `balsamactivate` line is automatically included in each launcher job,
    as you will see in the **qsubmit/** job scripts. This helps to ensure
    that jobs start up successfully, even if the server was killed while the
    job was waiting in the queue

Switching Databases
----------------------
You can also use `balsamactivate` to switch context between different databases.
The command prompt decorator should always show you which database the environment
is currently pointing at.  Moreover, the command :bash:`balsam which` will 
provide detailed information on the current active DB.

If you want to kill a DB server, first check what node it's running on 
with `balsam which` and log into that node. You can then identify the
parent server process and kill it gracefully by sending SIGTERM:

.. code-block:: bash
    :emphasize-lines: 4,6

    [BalsamDB: foo] $  ps aux | grep $USER | grep postgres
    user  39608  0.0  0.0  6495720    980   ??  Ss    4:29PM   0:00.00 postgres: checkpointer process
    user  39606  0.0  0.0  4321984    820   ??  Ss    4:29PM   0:00.00 postgres: logger process
    user  39605  0.0  0.4  6496000  72072 s002  S     4:29PM   0:00.06 /path/to/bin/postgres -D /home/user/foo/balsamdb

    [BalsamDB: foo] $ kill 39605
