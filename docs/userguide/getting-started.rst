Getting Started

The following sections contain quick instructions for getting started
on specific machines.

Theta (@ALCF)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The fastest way to get Balsam on Theta is to load the module.

.. highlight:: console

::
    
    $ module load balsam
    $ which balsam
    /soft/datascience/Balsam/0.3.5.1/env/bin/balsam
    $ which python
    /soft/datascience/Balsam/0.3.5.1/env/bin/python


As you can see, the module loads a Python 3.6 environment with pre-configured
Balsam installation. Don't worry if your applications rely on different environments
or Python installations. You can simply use the Balsam Python
environment to set up and manage your workflows, while a different version of
Python runs in the backend.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ soft add +anaconda
    $ conda config --add channels intel
    $ conda create -p ~/BalsamEnv intelpython3_core python=3.6
    $ source activate ~/BalsamEnv

    $ conda install mpi4py
    $ pip install balsam-flow
    

Installation
--------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Balsam requires Python 3.6 or later**. Preferably, set up an isolated
virtualenv or conda environment for Balsam. It's no problem if some
applications in your workflow run in different Python environments. You will
need setuptools 39.2 or newer:

.. highlight:: console

::

    $ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools


Some Balsam components require mpi4py_,  so
it is best to install Balsam in an environment with `mpi4py` already in place
and configured for your platform.  **At the minimum**, a working MPI
implementation and `mpicc` compiler wrapper should be in the search path, in
which case the `mpi4py` dependency will automatically build and install.

cython_ is also used to compile some
CPU-intensive portions of the Balsam service.  While the Cython dependency will
also be installed if it's absent, it is preferable to have an existing version
built with your platform-tuned compiler wrappers.

Finally, Balsam requires PostgreSQL version 9.6.4 or newer to be installed. You can verify
that PostgreSQL is in the search `PATH` and the version is up-to-date with:

.. highlight:: console

::

    $ pg_ctl --version

It's very easy to get the `PostgreSQL binaries`_ if you
don't already have them.  Simply adding the PostgreSQL `bin/` to your search
PATH should be enough to use Balsam without having to bother a system
administrator.

Installation from PyPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. highlight:: console

::

    $ pip install balsam-flow


.. _BalsamInit:

Create a Balsam DB to start working
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can use the command line to start working with Balsam. 
`balsam init` is used to create a new database at the specified path. 
`source balsmactivate` takes a database path (or unique substring) and 
starts up the database.


.. highlight:: console

::

    $ balsam init ~/myWorkflow
    $ source balsamactivate myWorkflow
    $ balsam app --name SayHello --executable "echo hello,"
    $ balsam job --name hi --workflow test --application SayHello --args "World!"
    $ balsam submit-launch -A MyProject -q DebugQueue -t 5 -n 1 --job-mode=mpi
    $ watch balsam ls   #  follow status in realtime from command-line

.. note::
    For production workflows, be sure to create a database on the appropriate filesystem for your platform. 
    Typically, your home directory is not the right place for production I/O!
