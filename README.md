Balsam makes it easy to manage large compute campaigns on a supercomputer:
- Many independent application runs (i.e. classic ensemble jobs)
- Many instances of workflows, with inter-task dependencies forming graphs
- Dynamic workflows, where some tasks spawn other tasks with the Python API
- Remotely submit workflows and track their progress
- Multi-user workflow management

Use a command-line interface or Python API to fill a database with a few dozen
or million tasks.  The Balsam components will automatically bundle your work
and talk to the system scheduler to allocate resources.  On the inside, a pilot
*launcher* process executes your workflows and keeps you informed of what's
going on.

## Installation

#### Prerequisites
Balsam requires Python 3.6 or later.  You will need setuptools 39.2 or newer:

```console
$ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
```

Some Balsam components require [mpi4py](https://github.com/mpi4py/mpi4py),  so
it is best to install Balsam in an environment with `mpi4py` already in place
and configured for your platform.  At the very least, a working MPI
implementation and `mpicc` compiler wrapper should be in the search path so
that the dependency can be automatically installed.

[cython](https://github.com/cython/cython) is also used to compile some
CPU-intensive portions of the Balsam service.  While the Cython dependency will
also be installed if it's absent, it is preferable to have an existing version
built with your platform-tuned compiler wrappers.

Finally, Balsam requires PostgreSQL version 9.6.4 or newer to be installed. You can verify
that PostgreSQL is in the search `PATH` and the version is up-to-date with

```console
$ pg_ctl --version
```

It's very easy to [get the PostgreSQL binaries](https://www.enterprisedb.com/download-postgresql-binaries) if you
don't already have them.  Simply adding the PostgreSQL `bin/` to your search
PATH should be enough to use Balsam without having to bother a system
administrator.

#### Quick setup

```console
$ pip insall balsam-flow
$ balsam init ~/myWorkflow
$ source balsamactivate myWorkflow
```

Once a Balsam DB is activated, you can use the command line to manage your workflows:

```console
$ balsam app --name SayHello --executable "echo hello,"
$ balsam job --name hi --workflow test --application SayHello --args "World!"
$ balsam ls
```
