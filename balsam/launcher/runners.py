'''
The actual execution of BalsamJob applications occurs in **Runners** which
delegate a list of **BalsamJobs** to one or more **Workers**, which are an
abstraction for the local computing resources. Each **Runner** subclass hides
system-dependent MPI details and executes jobs in a particular mode, such as:

    * ``MPIRunner``: a single multi-node job
    * ``MPIEnsembleRunner``: several serial jobs packaged into one ensemble

.. note:: 
    The current command line tool ``balsam qsub`` is misleading because users
    can't qsub a script that calls mpirun.  We must implement a ``--mode
    script`` option that results in jobs which are handled by a
    ``ScriptRunner``. The ScriptRunner should parse the script to make sure it
    is not using more nodes than requested by the job; and perhaps identify and
    translate each ``mpirun`` in the script to the correct, local
    system-specific command.
